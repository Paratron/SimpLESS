SimpLESS Compiler 1.4
=====================

Description
-----------

LESS ( http://lesscss.org/ ) is a great tool to write CSS much faster.
But however - in the way its meant to be (running either on node.js or being interpreted by JavaScript in the browser) its just not usable for most web projects.
For the mac there is this great tool called LESS.app ( http://incident57.com/less/ ) but for linux and windows one has to struggle with command line scripts and worse things to compile his LESS files to plain CSS.
Who wants to setup a node.js server for this job?!

Me not ;)

So I decided to create a little compiler for LESS that runs on every platform.
It utilizes the appcelerator titanium platform ( http://appcelerator.com/ ) to achieve this task.

Changelog
---------

v 1.4

- tweaked UI
- removed the compilation options from the lesscode and implemented it into the UI
- the target CSS file to compile to can now be chosen from the UI
- implemented usage of http://prefixr.com for automatic CSS3 vendor prefixing
- embedded the most recent version of less - v 1.4.2
- implemented a automatic updater for the less compiler
- if a LESS file starts with a CSS block comment, SimpLESS will keep that comment after minification (i.e. for Wordpress)
- metric tonne of bugfixes


v 1.3

- implemented CSS minification (thanks to: https://github.com/GoalSmashers/clean-css )
